The following exercise comes from Brant Deppa's textbook on Supervised Learning used at Winona State University: 

Goal: Use the diamonds dataset to explore concepts related to supervised learning in a multiple linear regression setting. 
```{r}
#Reading in the diamonds data
diamonds <- read.csv("Diamonds.csv", header = TRUE)

#Definitions of a few terms: 
#TDdiff = Table - Depth
#TDRatio = Table/Depth (i.e. the ratio of table to depth)

summary(diamonds)

#Using boxplots to look at the relationship between price and clarity
boxplot(Price~Clarity, col = "lightblue", xlab = "Clarity", ylab = "Price ($)", data = diamonds)
```
